title: Dear Future Wife/Marriage Manifesto
---
Today, I will try to describe some of the things that I would like my future
wife to know about me, as well as the contents of what I like to call,
"The Marriage Manifesto".

At a high level, this post is going to be split into the following sections:

* [__Who/Why__](#who/why): This section describes the intended audience of this
post, as well as my reasoning behind writing it.
(Beyond this section, I will change the tone of my writing as if I am talking
directly to someone who could potentially be my life partner.)
* [__About Me__](#about-me): Here I will give a brief overview of who I am.
While reading this section, ask yourself, is this the type of person who you can see yourself
spending the rest of your life with?
* [__My Ideal Soul-mate__](#ideal-soul-mate): While I don't necessarily believe in soul-mates (and
frankly this title sounds pretty cheesy), here I will outline the type of mate
that I'm looking for. I will break this section down into two parts, the
"non-negotiables", and the "nice-to-haves". If you don't satisfy a criteria in
the first category, then it's a deal-breaker. On the other hand, satisfying
items from the second category earn you bonus points but none of them are
absolute necessities (though lacking a significant number of characteristics from
this list may aggregate into a deal-breaker).
* [__Our Life Together__](#life-together): This is pretty self explanatory. Here I will discuss how
I envision our life together.
* [__Topics For Conversation__](#conversation-topics): A bullet point list for random
topics I want to talk about with my wife/significant-other during the course of us getting
to know each other. TBH, I'm afraid that if I list everything here, we won't have anything
interesting left to talk about when we get married. Oh well, we'll cross that bridge when
we get there :shrug:.

Some of these sections may overlap with each other, since it's quite hard
to isolate certain points so that they fall in exactly one of these categories.

<a name="who/why"></a>The Who and The Why
===================

As I alluded to earlier, this blog post is primarily oriented towards
potential candidates that I might consider marrying, which means women
(most likely Indian, probably Gujarati) between the ages of 18-25.

The question of why is trickier to answer. On one hand, it may seem naive of
me to assume that I can systematically identify criterion for a person that
I would fall in love with. On the other, I feel that the current mechanisms
for finding one's significant other are primitive and out-dated. As an
intellectual, I rely on my neocortex for analyzing situations and making
the correct decision when confronted with life-changing questions. While I
rely on my primitive, animalistic nature to make the appropriate flight-or-flight
response in life-or-death situations. However, in today's society, it is
deemed acceptable to simply make the decision of who one is going to marry
based on feelings of "love".

The objective for today isn't to debate the validity of "love". In fact, I'm
not sure if there is such a thing as "love", and this question should probably
be reserved for the last section of this post. Nevertheless, I am convinced
that the modern notions of romantic love have become synonymous with the
release of dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin. These chemical reactions are what inexperienced
people often confuse with love, and can easily become the basis of bad decisions such
as getting married with the wrong person. Worse yet, once one understands
this, one can easily manipulate the release of these chemicals in others to
achieve nefarious objectives. Therefore, I believe that it is vital to involve
the pre-frontal cortex when making, what is arguably the most important
decision of one's life.

While, this blog post primarily acts as a mechanism for my neocortex to
isolate and summarize the requirements for someone I would marry, it also
serves a more practical purpose. Some simple calculations say that there are
potentially on the order of 100K to 1M women who would fit what I would call
the "on-paper" criteria for potentially eligible brides (for me at least).
These are filters such as gender, age, ethnicity, religion, looks. The typical
filters that people use when sorting from a list of potential candidates on
matrimonial or dating websites. However, meeting all of these women, getting to know them,
and then deciding whom I like is simply an intractable problem.

This blog post
provides me with a mechanism for making the search process more efficient;
potential candidates can read this and make a more informed decision on whether
or not we would be compatible quickly! Furthermore, I can take advantage of
crowd sourcing by providing this post to third-parties who would be interested
in setting me up with a woman (eg. friends, family etc.) by giving them more
well defined search criteria (and potentially a finders fee, say, $5,000 to get
them really motivated).

Why you might ask? Your significant other is the one
person in your life that will be with you the longest (potentially 70+ years).
Therefore, it is reasonable for you to put significant effort in trying to
optimize the objective function of finding the most compatible mate.

Lastly, this blog post exists as a means for me to think about the type of
person I am, who I want to be with, and what I want my future to look like.
In that sense, the act of writing the blog post, even if nothing comes of it,
is it's own reward.


<a name="about-me"></a>About Me
========

Who Am I?
---------

This is a tough question to answer. It is one of life's biggest mysteries.
Looking inward, trying to establish a sense of identity, and forever pursuing
a better you is something that one should do their entire life. Therefore, the
question "Who Am I?" is never truly answered. Nevertheless, I'll try to
answer the basics of this question and leave the deeper philosophical ideas for
later in this blog post, and subsequent other posts.

Let's see, on paper, I'm a 24-year-old Software Developer who graduated from
Cornell University and is (as of writing this), working on Uber-cool projects
related to self-driving vehicles. [Check it out!](https://www.uberatc.com)
I enjoy working out, watching movies/TV, playing video games (I do the latter
two way more than I probably should) and outdoorsy activities such as hiking/biking.

Now, if this were a dating profile, or a matrimonial profile (i.e. [OkCupid](https://www.okcupid.com)/[shaadi.com](https://www.shaadi.com))
that would be all the information provided to you to base your decision on
whether or not to contact me. That's just plain stupid!

So here's a bit more information (Note that while you are reading this, it would
be very helpful to think about how these points would play with your lifestyle):

* I'm a man who follows a (relatively) tight routine, especially on my workout days
  - During the work week, my schedule usually tends to be: Wake up at 6:00AM, eat
  breakfast, get ready, go to the gym for a couple of hours. Try to get into the
  office by 10:30AM. The benefit of being a developer is I get to make my own
  hours, but the downside to that this can fluctuate a lot and I hate myself for
  going to work after 11:00AM (even if no one cares). I get home around 7:00PM,
  eat, unwind (maybe watch TV or a movie) and go to bed by 10:00PM. My friend
  calls me "grandpa" haha! :smile:
    - Fridays and weekends are much more unstructured, and obviously so are
    vacations. There is a lot more I could say here, but I will move on since
    subsequent bullet points have a higher ROI.
* When I am focused on a challenging problem, I am in my __DO NOT DISTURB__ mode:
  - This bullet point is primarily
  a carryover from my college days and is far less applicable now that
  work is quite independent from my personal life. Nevertheless, I feel it
  necessary to include here since it is a vital part of my personality, and
  applies to so much more than just my work (obviously, I have other things
  I want to accomplish outside of my career).
  - So, what exactly do I mean by this? Well, if I become engrossed in a problem
  I'll often forget about the basics, such as eating, sleeping, or drinking water.
  Solving the problem will be at the forefront of my brain no matter what I'm
  doing, and it becomes an itch that makes it difficult to focus on anything else.
  I think it is very important for whoever my life-partner is to be able to
  understand this feeling.
* I need to be active (both physically and mentally):
  - As much as I enjoy traveling, and bumming around on weekends doing nothing, I
  am the type of person who gets bored by it and needs to do some work during a
  vacation (beyond a week) just to keep myself occupied (Note that the work need
  not be related to my job).
  - I also get very irritable if I haven't gone to the gym in a while, or if my
  workout schedule is somehow disturbed due to travel, time off etc. I'll make
  travel decisions, and choose hotels based upon the gyms available nearby so that
  I can make sure I get some exercise in even if I am on vacation. During my last
  few trips to India, I even packed my bags full of protein powder just so I could keep my diet and workout schedule
  on point during a month of travel (it took up more space than my clothes!).
    - I like vacations which involve a lot of physical exercise (walking, hiking, biking,
      tennis, etc.)
    so I can at least keep my cardio up even if I'm out of the gym
* I focus on exactly one primary thing at a time in my life, and make that the priority above all
   else. All of the decisions I make during that time are centered around how they can help me
   achieve the primary goal.
    - I like to work hard, and play hard.


Entities I Associate With
-------------------------

* [Swami Vivekananda][Vivekananda]/[Pandurang-Shashri Athevle][Dadaji]
(Dadaji if you are a "Swadhyayie". Completely butchered the spelling of that word.)
  - Vivekananda was one of the greatest figures in Indian history, and a person that I look up to
  and respect a lot. First and foremost, I highly recommend everyone who is interested in the
  Vedic philosophy to read his wiki entry, followed up with 'The Complete Works of Swami
  Vivekananda' (a 9-volume collection of his works). Although the English translation of his works
  aren't perfect, they are only matched in quality and level-of-thinking by the likes of Ramanuja 
  and Ramakrishna. These were the greatest thinkers of their time who brought forth the
  [non-dualistic][Nondualism] school of thought and really took Indian philosophy and the Vedanta to new 
  heights.
    - Today, while India has forgotten that it gave birth to some of the greatest practical 
    philosophy of all time, these thoughts are being carefully analyzed in the West at places
    like Cornell, Stanford, and Oxford.
    - One of the most important things I can do for myself is to properly understand, and 
    internalize this school of thought because I have walked down the path far enough to know
    that it is the way to enlightenment of the mind and that great beauty lies at the end of
    a challenging road.
  - Dadaji was another great entity from recent history who I respect for his attempt to bring
  this school of thought to the masses. He took the complex philosophy of the Advaita and
  distilled it to its essence so that even a young child could easily grasp the basic thoughts.
    - While his life's work resulted in a great deal of impact for a large number of people,
    since he passed away, Swadhyay has not been the same.
  - These are entities who have carved out a path to uplift man and provided them an elevator to
  heaven instead of a staircase. Eventually, one, if 
  lucky, reaches a point in their life where all of these philosophies seem childlike. My goal is
  to one day reach that point with the aggregate teachings of the Advaita, to one day, be forced
  to do research to come up with my own answers to my questions.
* Sheldon Cooper from 'The Big Bang Theory'
  - While I share some characteristics with all four of the main characters in the show,
  Sheldon is definitely the one that I associate myself with the most. In fact, I'm somewhat
  envious of his ability to focus on his work despite the personal drama that goes on around
  him, as well as his didactic memory. Furthermore, things like the roommate agreement, and the
  relationship agreement, seem like perfectly reasonable things to me. They would be things
  that I could see myself drafting up in real life (if I ever had the time).
  - Nevertheless, there are a few characteristics that we definitely do not share, such as
  his aversion to human contact. I am very much a "touch" person, by which I mean that I
  only feel close to someone through the sense of touch, as opposed to talking with them.
  I also strongly believe that sex is a vital part of a relationship and something that
  draws people together. The idea of not having sex for X years, or not having sex before marriage,
  is simply not an option for me.
    - Thinking about it practically, one would want the person they marry to be the one they
    have the best physical experience with as well. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with
    me on this, but I feel strongly about that.
* Cumberbatch's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in 'Sherlock'
  - I share a lot of the same characteristics as Sherlock during times of stress or intense focus.
  When I'm thinking about a particularly challenging problem, I need complete silence and no
  distractions. I also often build a "mind-temple" to help me associate words, people and concepts
  with one another during times of focus.
* A Tiger :tiger:
  - The physical strength and fierceness of tigers are two of their most appealing characteristics.
  For some reason, I have always been attracted to tigers, and I hope to even own a pair of
  tigers one day (a pair so they can breed and don't die in captivity).
* A little kid
  - I love kids, and I often am childlike when it comes to things like cars, toys, video games etc.
  I make an effort to preserve my childhood innocence and boyish wonder as years go on.
  - The quintessential example of when I'm a little kid in a candy store is when I'm learning new
  computer science algorithms, or thinking about physics and mathematics. __IT'S JUST SO FREAKING
  COOL!!__
  - On the other hand, I'm also a child when it comes to getting shots, visiting the doctor or
  when I'm sick, tired, sleepy or hungry. Sometimes that's not a good thing, but my ideal
  life-partner would be someone who finds that cute, and sees the charm in it. Hopefully though,
  I'll grow up just a little bit before I have kids so that she doesn't have to deal with one
  more kid (I doubt it though :P).
* Just some "regular" guy
  - Just like everyone else I get jealous/angry, want to be a bum, sometimes desire things
  which aren't good for me, enjoy sex etc.

<a name="ideal-soul-mate"></a>My Ideal Soul-mate
=================

__NOTE:__ At this point, the blog post was taking too long to write, so I might have cut some 
corners below and not delved into the issues
as much as I should have.

The "Non-Negotiables":
----------------------

Below is a list of characteristics that are absolutely necessary for us to work as a
couple.

* Intelligence, determination, and a drive to accomplish whatever you set your mind to.
  - By intelligence, I mean a combination of book smarts as well as general common sense.
  This is extremely important to me for a number of reasons. First, and foremost, it's essentially
  a prerequisite for me to respect you. Next, I believe that intelligent people have an obligation
  to society to reproduce, and pass on their genes to create an even smarter next-generation. I 
  think of it like the counteracting force to slow down the momentum of idiots reproducing and 
  making the world into [Idiocracy][Idiocracy] (highly recommend that movie if you haven't seen it). Also, for
  whatever it's worth Elon Musk agrees with this general thought process (his [biography][Elon biography] is pretty
  cool, check that out as well).
    - Communications is obviously important to a healthy relationship, and my willingness to
    communicate with someone goes hand-in-hand with how intelligent they are. I can't stand people
    who like to gossip/small-talk, I believe that if you are going to exert the energy required
    to converse, then it better be about something meaningful/productive. If I don't believe you
    will understand and be able to contribute to a conversation in one of my areas of interest eg. 
    philosophy, science, mathematics, religion etc. I'll simply not bother discussing that with you
    which will not lead to a very productive relationship.
  - I'm a very determined/driven person, and I can't see myself getting along with someone that
  doesn't feel the same fire I do about something that they want to accomplish in life. I don't
  care so much about what it is you want to do (although I'll really like it if it's something
  that I have an interest in as well), but rather that whatever it is, you are determined to be
  the best of the best in that field.
    - These are ideologies that I plan on passing on to my children as well. I don't want them to
    grow up and start questioning me about why if I was so driven/ambitious I settled for someone
    whose the opposite of that.
* You need to be the type of person who prioritizes healthy living
  - Go work out, do yoga, follow a diet etc. I spend about two hours at the gym every day, I
  expect my significant other to give equal importance to her body and well being. While there
  are certain factors in life which are beyond our control, this is one that is definitely well
  within your control, and something that should be prioritized if you want to live a healthy life.
* You absolutely must be interested in philosophy/spirituality
  - I'm about 95% sure that whoever I end up marrying will be Hindu, or come from a Hindu family.
  Which is great, in the sense that we would have shared cultural values, and family backgrounds.
  But it also sucks, because Hinduism is one of the most misunderstood (and in a sense poisoned)
  religions/philosophies. I expect you to have given some thought to the "big picture" questions:
  "Who am I?", "Why am I here?", "What lies beyond this world (and what came before it)?" and
  assuming you believe in god: "What is 'God'?".  
  Think of it like this, if you had a PhD in CS
  and were looking for a partner to start a research lab with, you wouldn't team up with a high
  school graduate with just an intro to CS course would you? Similarly, I don't believe the
  philosophical/spiritual journey has an end, but I expect you to be at a certain level so that
  we can push ahead together, instead of waiting around all my life for you to catch up.

The "Nice-to-haves":
--------------------

__Update__(2017-01-16):

Apparently, since there has been some confusion regarding this section, let me clarify the title
once again. The characteristics below are "nice to have" in a girl. In the sense that, if I were
to design the ideal soulmate in a lab, I'd instill these characteristics into her. That does
__NOT__ mean however, that I'm absolutely opposed to meeting you if you do not satisfy a large
subset of these criteria.

Furthermore, for the sake of clarity: Smoking and drugs are in the "deal-breaker" category
whereas the nice-to-haves regarding lifestyle would be someone who doesn't drink and is vegatarian.
The drinking one is a bit nuanced however, since for me, someone who consumes alcohol at a high
frequency (greater than once a week) would end up being crossed off under the "deal-breaker"
category.

* Be a swathyayie (again totally not spelling that correctly)
  - This takes care of the last bullet-point above. It's like when you look at someone's resume
  and see they graduated from an Ivy league college. You implicitly have some faith that they 
  can't be complete idiots.
* Speaking of which, attend (or have graduated from) Ivy league or equivalent school.
  - Your college years are some of the most formative years that define who you are going to be in
  life in a lot of ways. Being from a top-tier school definitely matters because we will have
  more shared experiences and be able to connect at a certain level that we simply cannot if you
  graduated from some random community college. Plus, the colleges have an application process which
  is meant to evaluate your intelligence and qualifications (in theory), I shouldn't be redoing the
  work on that front again.
* Be a STEM person (for those that don't know. STEM = Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)
  - I don't really want to write off non-STEM people without meeting them, but it's highly unlikely
  that we would get along, based on my past experiences and ex-girlfriends.
  - Also, its nice to know you'll be able to do something useful in society and actually get a job
  - __Update (2017-01-16):__ For the purposes of this conversation, I'm going to classify both
  Philosophy and Psychology majors under "Science" even though neither is thought of a hard-science. I would
  be extremely surprised if this really makes much of a difference to anyone reading this however
  since I have yet to meet a single Indian girl who is either a Philosophy or Psychology major.
* Know at least some level of computer science
  - CS is a vital skill set in the 21st century. If you are a CS nerd like me, that's awesome I 
  already like you (we need more women in CS, go out and recruit some more).
* Be interested in one or more of these subjects: Computer Science, Physics (especially
astrophysics or quantum mechanics), or Mathematics
* Be a good writer
  - I'd like us to start a blog together, but I'm super lazy when it comes to writing, and not
  at all good (as evidence by this website).
* Know how to cook well
  - This one is extremely important.
* Possess some sort of skill that I'd want to learn
  - Maybe something like singing, dancing etc. You could draw, and that's cool, but I know I'll
  never be able to draw so I'm not going to even bother (though you'll definitely get bonus points for it).
* Be attractive (naturally beautiful)
  - Obviously no one WANTS to be with an ugly person
  - As a prerequisite, if I'm talking to you as part of one of those arranged marriage setups, I require
  a photo of you WITHOUT makeup on. I want to know the face I'll be staring at when we are in bed, not
  what other people will be staring at when we go out.
  _Must control self from ranting about makeup_
* Don't be a stereotypical girl
  - By this I mean someone who is clicky, needy, talks all the time about pointless things, has to have
  makeup on in order to go out, or wastes money in meaningless and inherently worthless
  expenditures such as handbags, shoes, diamond jewelry etc.
    - Oh boy, I can go on a rant here about how utterly useless diamonds are and no reasonably 
    logical person should ever buy a diamond but for the sake of sanity I'll restrain myself.
    - If you want to buy something, go buy gold (preferably bricks). Gold is actually a sane investment
    strategy.

<a name="life-together"></a>Our Life Together
=================

Obviously there are tons of things I want to do with you, after all, if we are going to be together
for seventy to eighty years of our lives, we better have some way to pass that time.

Here's a small list of some of the things we will do:

* Travel: I enjoy traveling (ok I don't enjoy traveling, but I enjoy seeing places), so expect to go
 to a lot of natural/scenic places eg. Hawaii, Iceland, parks, hikes, long drives etc. as long
as you take responsibility of planning everything. If you leave it to me, we will never leave the
living room :smile:
* Discuss philosophy: At some point when the house is paid off, I'm 100% certain I'll just quit
working and leave everything behind. Go off somewhere and write a couple of books answering
some of the important questions of life (it's probably a good idea to do this before we have kids
isn't it?). Until then, conversations over dinner and on lazy Saturday afternoons will have
to make due. Maybe we can start a blog together (if you are the type of person who likes writing).
* Raise five kids: Oh heck yea I want five kids! Well in the ideal world I do anyway. In the
practical real world where kids cost money, I think I might only have two or three. Kids
are awesome (don't worry, we'll dump them off at my parents house until they are potty trained
:stuck_out_tongue:)
* Have lots of sex (obviously, as if there was any doubt)


<a name="conversation-topics"></a>Topics For Conversation
=================

Random topics of conversation that will help you get to know me better. Some of these I've thought
about for a long time, others not so much.

__General Questions:__

* How do we ensure proper communication/discussion without influencing the other person of
our personal biases/view-points?
* Along the same lines, during the initial phase of getting to know each other, how do I make
sure that when I ask you something you are telling me your own ideas instead of piggy backing
on mine because you liked my answer to that question better? Or if the order of questioning was
the other way around, how do you ensure that?
  - One solution is that we pose a question, write each of our answers down, and give each other
  the piece of paper. This is slow and doesn't facilitate a discussion.
* One more on communication: How do we ensure the other person feels comfortable enough to share
their viewpoints openly and without hesitation as quickly as possible (especially in an arranged
marriage sort of setting)?
  - This is more for you than me, I'm an open book. I'll say whatever is on my mind to whoever,
  doesn't matter if we met 5 minutes ago and you don't even know me. Which probably isn't the
  best, but it gets the job done quickly. With so many potential mates to search and sort, time
  is a critical component.

__On love:__

* What is "love" (in the context of a relationship/significant other)? Also, do you
even believe in romantic love?
* How does one balance love with other principles/philosophies in life?

__On Marriage (I'll put out a blog on this summarizing my ideas... eventually :wink:):__

* Describe to me, in your own words, what "marriage" means?
* Why do you want to get married?
* How do you know that you are ready to take on the responsibility of marriage?
* If you were looking for a partner, what algorithm would you employ to maximize your chances of
success, and what would your search-parameters/optimization criteria be?

__Personal Principles/Life Philosophy:__

* What are the set of personal principles that you live by, and why?
* Will your principles work alongside mine, or do we have any clashes? In situations where
things don't align properly, what is the proposed course of action so that if we end up together
these issues don't come back up a few years down the road?

__Miscellaneous Other Topics:__

* What life was like for me growing up in India.
* The trajectory of my family (the effort my grandparents/parents put in to get us to where
  we are today).
* College experiences (study sessions, homeworks/exams, girlfriends etc.).
* Random childhood memories.
* Child-rearing ideologies.
