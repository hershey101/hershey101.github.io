title: Considerations for Marriage
---

In today's post, I'll try to summarize some of my ideas on marriage, it's
importance, and considerations one should make prior to getting married. I'll
prefice this post by saying, unlike the previous posts on my blog, most of the
contents of this post is very personal. It doesn't matter to me whether you
agree/disagree with my viewpoints, my goal isn't to convince anyone that my
viewpoints on this topic are correct but rather to get people thinking about the various topics outlined
below so that they can make a more balanced, well thought-out decision within
their lives.
I appreciate feedback from people, especially those that are
already on the other side of the fence: married and have kids, to give
critisims and tell me how naive my world view is :smile:.


## A Quick Background
Ok, so why in the world am I, a 23 year-old guy in NYC, writing about a blog
post about marriage. It seems strange, but really, it's not so strange when you
consider my ethnicity. Indians tend to get married a lot younger than most
westerners, and I have always been far more mature than most people my age (my
best friend jokingly calls me "grandpa" because I go to sleep at 10pm and wake
up at 6am). My parents, like most Indian parents, take a fairly active role in
my life. I greatly appreciate that (for the most part), and value their input
(even if I seldom change my decisions :smile:). So, when they mentioned they
were looking for brides my reaction was: "meh, ok have fun". While I have always
had a pretty good idea about what I wanted from my married life, this trigged me
to take a deeper look into my thoughts on marriage for one simple reason; time.

Some quick back-of-the-envolope math shows that out of the ~7 billion people in the
world, there are potentially on the order of 1M girls that would fit my
criterion of an eligible candidate based on what I call, "on paper" qualificiations:
eg. age, ethnicity, religion, education, looks, etc. The filters you can quickly
apply to get rid of the people you wouldn't even consider. However, in order to
get that number down to one (after all, you will only end up marrying one person,
hopefully), one needs to get to "know" the other person (whatever that means).
