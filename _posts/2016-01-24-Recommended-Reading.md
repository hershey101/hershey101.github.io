Here is a list of blogs, posts, books etc. that I recommend reading (sorted by my interests):

Deep Learning/Artificial Intelligence
-------------------------------------
* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com): A good introductory book for deep learning. It's a quick read and a great place to start getting some hands-on experience
* Yoshua Bengio's [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org): A graduate-level textbook covering all the basics of deep learning, neural networks. This book starts from the basics and takes the reader up to open research problems. A great way to get up to speed if you want to do research, and a good point for having the context needed to understand research papers/publications.

Philosophy
----------
* [Wait But Why Blog](http://www.waitbutwhy.com): A great blog for asking the deeper questions in everyday life.
* 

Fitness
-------
* [Bodybuilding website](http://www.bodybuilding.com)
