title: What Is Marriage?
---
I was in the process of writing my "Marriage Manifesto", a blog post describing
who I am, what my ideal wife is like, and how I envision married life. However,
while writing this saga (it ended up being a bit too long to be considered a
"blog post" anymore), I recognized that in order to properly identify the important
characteristics that I want from a life-partner, I first need to properly define the
term "marriage". Therefore, today I will spend a bit of time musing about what defines
"marriage", and looking at the relationship from various lenses: economical, social/cultural,
and religious/philosophical. Although each of these perspectives on marriage
could easily fill an entire post (maybe multiple), I'll try to keep this a fairly
concise diversion from working on my Marriage Manifesto.


The Economic (or Pragmatic) Perspective
===================

From an economic point-of-view the idea of marriage, or marriage-like relationship, has
limited benefits with significant downsides in my perspective.

The positives include:

* A sharing of life's fixed costs: The day-to-day act of living consists of some fixed
costs.
One must pay for housing, cable, and electricity; expenses which account for a significant
part of one's post-tax income for middle-class or upper middle-class individuals.
In addition to monetary expenses, there are other fixed costs (or relatively fixed costs)
associated with being alive such as having to do laundry, clean the house, cook, go shopping
for basic necessities. These mundane tasks take up precious time that could be better
invested elsewhere. Having a life-partner/significant other can help cut these fixed costs
in half because each individual only has to do roughly half the work (eg. it's just as much
time to put N pieces of clothing in the washer/dryer as 2N pieces). The cost of living
effectively gets cut in half because the rent/mortgage now covers two people instead of
one. Of course there are caveats with this but in an idealized and simplified world this line of 
reasoning works for the most part. Although being legally married is not required for this
benefit (a marriage-like relationship suffices), I'll go ahead say this is an economic benefit of
being married.

On the other hand, there are many downsides to being legally married from an economic perspective:

* Without the proper legal protocols in place, being legally married basically means that both
parties share debt. This is okay for the most part if you are marrying a fiscally responsible
person, but nevertheless, you have now introduced financial risk with due to black-swan
events that occur with non-zero probability.
* In the case that you end up filing for divorce, 



The Social/Cultural Perspective
===================


The Emotional Perspective
===========

Well I'll start this off by saying, I'm probably not the most qualified person to comment on
human emotions. They continue to baffel me.


The Philosophical/Spiritual Perspective
==============

It's interesting to look at what "marriage" is from a philosophical or spiritual perspective because
in my opinion, this is the only view-point which provides strong convincing reasons for why one
should get married. Before I dig too deep into this, I'll say that this section is highly subjective
and the following is based on my personal philosophical ideas, and therefore may not apply to everyone.

While I categorize myself as an "Hindu" (in terms of drop-down boxes), I believe in the Vedanta,
specifically in the Advita Vedanta or non-dualism (with some qualified non-dualism sprinkled in there).
While a deep dive into the Vedanta philosophy is out of the scope of this blog post, I'll summarize it
as the belief that reality spans multiple states/dimensions, and consists of a single source of
matter (akasha) and force (prana) acting upon the matter through the desire of the Cosmic Mind.
The argument being that what we see around us, the individual self and the individual souls, are
essentially reflections of the one self through various lenses with a central question of the philosophy
being "how do we lift this veil?"

From this perspective, marriage is no longer the generally understood concept of two people, separate
individuals who consist of a separate mind, body, and soul, spending time together.
Rather, marriage is an institution put in place for one to practice the ideas of the Vedanta in real
life. To spend every day, every menial moment together, doing all the pointless acts humans that
make us humans; eating, sleeping, working, watching movies, laughing, crying, arguing. Only to give us
a playground, a sandbox to practice the ideas of the Vedanta and lift the veil of false separation.
Basically, the idea being, if you cannot see the oneness of the soul even with the person you spend
the overwhelming majority of your life with, it's nearly impossible to recognize the oneness of all
of the entities in the universe.

In this case, the institution of marriage offers one path, or a single stepping stone along one
of many paths, to answer a central question to the Adivita Vedanta philosophy.
This, I think, is the only reasonable argument for why marriage is a desirable state worth pursuing.
