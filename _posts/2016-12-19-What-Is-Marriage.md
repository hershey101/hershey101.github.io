title: What Is Marriage?
---
I was in the process of writing my "Marriage Manifesto", a blog post describing
who I am, what my ideal wife is like, and how I envision married life. However,
while writing this saga (it ended up being a bit too long to be considered a
"blog post" anymore), I recognized that in order to properly identify the important
characteristics that I want from a life-partner, I first need to properly define the
term "marriage". Therefore, today I will spend a bit of time musing about what defines
"marriage", and looking at the relationship from various lenses: economical, social/cultural,
and religious/philosophical. Although each of these perspectives on marriage
could easily fill an entire post (maybe multiple), I'll try to keep this a fairly
concise diversion from working on my Marriage Manifesto (which I hope to have completed
this week).


The Economic (or Pragmatic) Perspective
===================

From an economic point-of-view, the idea of marriage, or marriage-like relationship, has
limited benefits with significant downsides in my perspective. , exactly one benefit there are very few reasons to get legally married


The Social/Cultural Perspective
===================
