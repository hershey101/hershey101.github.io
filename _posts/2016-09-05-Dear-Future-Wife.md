title: Dear Future Wife/Marriage Manifesto
---
Today, I will try to describe some of the things that I would like my future
wife to know about me, as well as the contents of what I like to call,
"The Marriage Manifesto". At a high level, this post is going to be split into
the following sections (from here on, I will frequently change the tone of my
writing as if I am talking directly to someone who could, potentially be my
life-partner):

* Who/Why: These sections describe the intended audience of this post, as well
my reasoning behind writing it.
* About Me: Here I will give a brief overview of who I am, while reading this
section, ask yourself, is this the type of person who you can see yourself
spending the rest of your life with.
* My Ideal Soulmate: While I don't necessarily believe in soulmates (and
frankly this title sounds pretty cheesy), here I will outline the type of mate
that I'm looking for. I will break this section down into two parts, the
"non-negotiables", and the "nice-to-haves". If you don't satisfy a criteria in
the first category, then it's a deal-breaker. On the other hand, satisfying
items from the second category earn you bonus points but none of them are
must haves.
* Our Life Together: This is pretty self-explanetory. Here I will discuss how
I envision our life together.
* Higher-level Spiritual/Philosophical Ideas: The reason I left this section
till the very end is that I would like this to be a starting point, and an
initial guide, for the hours long conversations we will un-doubtably have when
we meet. I will describe some basics here, but the idea is really for us to
converse about these topics when we meet in-person so that I can get know you
better.


The Who and The Why
------------------
As I alluded to earlier, this blog post is primarily oriented towards
potential candidates that I might consider marrying, which means women (
Indian, most likely Gujurati) between the ages of 18-25.

The question of why is trickier to answer. On one hand, it may seem naive of
me to assume that I can systematically identify certerion for a person that
I would fall in love with. On the other, I feel that the current mechanisms
for finding your significant other are primitive and out-dated. As an
intellectual, I rely on my neo-cortex for analyzing the situation and making
the correct decision when confronted with life-changing questions, and I rely
on my primitive, animalistic nature to make the appropriate flight-or-flight
response in life-or-death situations. However, in today's society, it is
deemed acceptable to simply make the decision of who one is going to marry
based on feelings of "love".

The objective for today isn't to debate the validity of "love". In fact, I'm
not sure if there is such a thing as "love", and this question should probably
be reserved for the last section of this post. Nevertheless, I am convinced
that the modern notions of romantic love have become synonmous with the
release of seratonin and norephenerphrin, and the firing of certain
neuro-receptors. These chemical reactions are what inexperienced people
often confuse with love, and can easily become the basis of bad-decisions such
as getting married with the wrong person. Worse yet, once one understands
this, one can easily manipulate the release of these chemicals in others to
achieve nefarious objectives. Therefore, I believe that it is vital to involve
the pre-frontal cortex when making, what is arguably the most important
decision of one's life.

While, this blog post primarily acts as a mechanism for my neo-cortex to
isolate and summarize the requirements for someone I would marry, it also
serves a more pratical purpose. Some simple calculations say that there are
potentially on the order of 100K to 1M women who would fit what I would call
the "on-paper" criteria for potentially eligible brides (for me at least).
These are filters such as gender, age, ethnicity, religion, looks. The typical
filters that Indians use when sorting from a list of potential candiates (
husbands or wives). However, meeting all of these women, getting to know them,
and then deciding whom I like is simply an intractable problem. This blog post
provides me with a mechanism for making the search process more efficient,
potential candidates can read this and make a more informed decision on whether
or not we would be compatible quickly! Furthermore, I can take advantage of
crowd-sourcing by providing this post to third-parties who would be interested
in setting me up with a woman (eg. friends, family etc.) by giving them more
well-defined search certeria (and potentially a finders fee, say, $5,000 to get
them really motivated). Why you might ask. Your significant other is the one
person in your life that will be with you the longest (potentially 70+ years).
Therefore, it is reasonable for you to put significant effort in trying to
optimize the objective function of finding the most compatible mate.

Lastly, this blog-post exists as a means for me to think about the type of
person I am, who I want to be with, and what I want my future to look like.
In that sense, the act of writing the blog post, even if nothing comes of it,
was it's own reward.


About Me
--------
## Who Am I?
This is a tough question to answer. It is one of life's biggest mysteries.
Looking inward, trying to establish a sense of identity, and forever pursuing
a better you is something that you do your entire life. Therefore, the
question "Who Am I?" is never truely answered. Nevertheless, I'll try to
answer the basics of this question and leave the deeper philophical ideas for
later in this blog post, and subsequent other posts.

Let's see, on paper, I'm a 23-year-old Software Developer who graduated from
Cornell University and is (as of writing this), working on Uber-cool projects
related to self-driving vehicles. [Check it out!](https://www.uberatc.com)
