title: Dear Future Wife/Marriage Manifesto
---
Today, I will try to describe some of the things that I would like my future
wife to know about me, as well as the contents of what I like to call,
"The Marriage Manifesto". At a high level, this post is going to be split into
the following sections:

* [__Who/Why__](#who/why): This section describes the intended audience of this
post, as well as my reasoning behind writing it.
(Beyond this section, I will change the tone of my writing as if I am talking
directly to someone who could potentially be my life-partner)
* [__About Me__](#about-me): Here I will give a brief overview of who I am.
While reading this section, ask yourself, is this the type of person who you can see yourself
spending the rest of your life with?
* [__My Ideal Soul-mate__](#ideal-soul-mate): While I don't necessarily believe in soul-mates (and
frankly this title sounds pretty cheesy), here I will outline the type of mate
that I'm looking for. I will break this section down into two parts, the
"non-negotiables", and the "nice-to-haves". If you don't satisfy a criteria in
the first category, then it's a deal-breaker. On the other hand, satisfying
items from the second category earn you bonus points but none of them are
absolute necessities (though lacking a significant number of characteristics from
this list may aggregate into a deal-breaker).
* [__Our Life Together__](#life-together): This is pretty self-explanatory. Here I will discuss how
I envision our life together.
* [__Higher-level Spiritual/Philosophical Ideas__](#philosophical-ideas): The reason I left this
section till the very end is that I would like this to be a starting point, and an
initial guide/road-map, for the hours long conversations we will undoubtedly have when
we meet. I will describe some basics here, but the idea is really for us to
converse about these topics when we meet in-person so that I can get know you
better.
* [__Other Topics For Conversation__](#other-conversation-topics): A bullet-point list for random
topics I want to talk about with my wife/significant-other during the course of us getting
to know each other. TBH, I'm afraid that if I list everything here, we won't have anything
interesting left to talk about when we get married. Oh well, we'll cross that bridge when
we get there :shrug:.

Some of these sections may overlap with each other, since it's quite hard
to isolate certain points so that they fall in exactly one of these categories.

<a name="who/why"></a>The Who and The Why
===================

As I alluded to earlier, this blog post is primarily oriented towards
potential candidates that I might consider marrying, which means women
(Indian, most likely Gujarati) between the ages of 18-25.

The question of why is trickier to answer. On one hand, it may seem naive of
me to assume that I can systematically identify criterion for a person that
I would fall in love with. On the other, I feel that the current mechanisms
for finding one's significant other are primitive and out-dated. As an
intellectual, I rely on my neo-cortex for analyzing situations and making
the correct decision when confronted with life-changing questions. On the other hand, I
rely on my primitive, animalistic nature to make the appropriate flight-or-flight
response in life-or-death situations. However, in today's society, it is
deemed acceptable to simply make the decision of who one is going to marry
based on feelings of "love".

The objective for today isn't to debate the validity of "love". In fact, I'm
not sure if there is such a thing as "love", and this question should probably
be reserved for the last section of this post. Nevertheless, I am convinced
that the modern notions of romantic love have become synonymous with the
release of dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin. These chemical reactions are what inexperienced
people often confuse with love, and can easily become the basis of bad-decisions such
as getting married with the wrong person. Worse yet, once one understands
this, one can easily manipulate the release of these chemicals in others to
achieve nefarious objectives. Therefore, I believe that it is vital to involve
the pre-frontal cortex when making, what is arguably the most important
decision of one's life.

While, this blog post primarily acts as a mechanism for my neo-cortex to
isolate and summarize the requirements for someone I would marry, it also
serves a more practical purpose. Some simple calculations say that there are
potentially on the order of 100K to 1M women who would fit what I would call
the "on-paper" criteria for potentially eligible brides (for me at least).
These are filters such as gender, age, ethnicity, religion, looks. The typical
filters that people use when sorting from a list of potential candidates on
matrimonial or dating websites. However, meeting all of these women, getting to know them,
and then deciding whom I like is simply an intractable problem. This blog post
provides me with a mechanism for making the search process more efficient;
potential candidates can read this and make a more informed decision on whether
or not we would be compatible quickly! Furthermore, I can take advantage of
crowd-sourcing by providing this post to third-parties who would be interested
in setting me up with a woman (eg. friends, family etc.) by giving them more
well-defined search criteria (and potentially a finders fee, say, $5,000 to get
them really motivated). Why you might ask. Your significant other is the one
person in your life that will be with you the longest (potentially 70+ years).
Therefore, it is reasonable for you to put significant effort in trying to
optimize the objective function of finding the most compatible mate.

Lastly, this blog post exists as a means for me to think about the type of
person I am, who I want to be with, and what I want my future to look like.
In that sense, the act of writing the blog post, even if nothing comes of it,
is it's own reward.


<a name="about-me"></a>About Me
========

Who Am I?
---------

This is a tough question to answer. It is one of life's biggest mysteries.
Looking inward, trying to establish a sense of identity, and forever pursuing
a better you is something that one should do their entire life. Therefore, the
question "Who Am I?" is never truly answered. Nevertheless, I'll try to
answer the basics of this question and leave the deeper philosophical ideas for
later in this blog post, and subsequent other posts.

Let's see, on paper, I'm a 24-year-old Software Developer who graduated from
Cornell University and is (as of writing this), working on Uber-cool projects
related to self-driving vehicles. [Check it out!](https://www.uberatc.com)
I enjoy working out, watching movies/TV, playing video games (I do the latter
two way more than I probably should) and outdoorsy activities such as hiking/biking.

Now, if this were a dating profile, or a matrimonial profile (i.e. okcupid.com/shaadi.com)
that would be all the information provided to you to base your decision on
whether or not to contact me. That's just plain stupid!

So here's a bit more information (Note that while you are reading this, it would
be very helpful to think about how these points would play with your lifestyle):

* I'm a man who follows a (relatively) tight routine, especially on my workout days
  - During the work-week, my schedule usually tends to be: Wake up at 6:00AM, eat
  breakfast, get ready, go to the gym for a couple of hours. Try to get into the
  office by 10:30AM. The benefit of being a developer is I get to make my own
  hours, but the downside to that this can fluctuate a lot and I hate myself for
  going to work after 11:00AM (even if no-one cares). I get home around 7:00PM,
  eat, unwind (maybe watch TV or a movie) and go to bed by 10:00PM. My friend
  calls me "grandpa" haha! :smile:
    - Fridays and weekends are much more unstructured, and obviously so are
    vacations. There is a lot more I could say here, but I will move on since
    subsequent bullet-points have a higher ROI.
* When I am focused on a challenging problem, I am in my __DO NOT DISTURB__ mode:
  - This bullet-point is primarily
  a carry-over from my college days and is far less applicable now that
  work is quite independent from my personal life. Nevertheless, I feel it
  necessary to include here since it is a vital part of my personality, and
  applies to so much more than just my work (obviously, I have other things
  I want to accomplish outside of my career).
  - So, what exactly do I mean by this? Well, if I become engrossed in a problem
  I'll often forget about the basics, such as eating, sleeping, or drinking water.
  Solving the problem will be at the forefront of my brain no matter what I'm
  doing, and it becomes an itch that makes it difficult to focus on anything else.
  I think it is very important for whoever my life-partner is to be able to
  understand this feeling.
* I need to be active (both physically and mentally):
  - As much as I enjoy traveling, and bumming around on weekends doing nothing, I
  am the type of person who gets bored by it and needs to do some work during a
  vacation (beyond a week) just to keep myself occupied (Note that the work need
  not be related to my job).
  - I also get very irritable if I haven't gone to the gym in a while, or if my
  workout schedule is somehow disturbed due to travel, time off etc. I'll make
  travel decisions, and choose hotels based upon the gyms available nearby so that
  I can make sure I get some exercise in even if I am on vacation. During my last
  few trips to India, I even packed my bags full of protein powder (it took up
  more space than my clothes!) just so I could keep my diet and workout schedule
  on point during a month of travel.
    - I like vacations which involve a lot of physical exercise (walking, hiking, biking,
      tennis, etc.)
    so I can at least keep my cardio up even if I'm out of the gym
* I focus on exactly one primary thing at a time in my life, and make that the priority above all
   else. All of the decisions I make during that time are centered around how they can help me
   achieve the primary goal.
    - I like to work hard, and play hard.


Entities I Associate With
-------------------------

* Swami Vivekananda/Pandurang-Shashri Athevle (Dadaji if you are a "Swadhyayie". Completely butchered the spelling of that word.)
  - Vivekananda was one of the greatest figures in Indian history, and a person that I look up to
  and respect a lot. First and foremost, I highly recommend everyone who is interested in the
  Vedic philosophy to read his wiki entry, followed up with 'The Complete Works of Swami
  Vivekananda' (a 9-volume collection of his works). Although the English translation of his works
  aren't perfect, they are only matched in quality and level-of-thinking by the likes of Ramanuja 
  and Ramakrishna. These were the greatest thinkers of their time who brought forth the
  non-dualistic school of thought and really took Indian philosophy and the Vedanta to new 
  heights.
    - Today, while India has forgotten that it gave birth to some of the greatest pratical 
    philosophy of all time, these thoughts are being carefully analyzed in the West at places
    like Cornell, Stanford, and Oxford.
    - One of the most important things I can do for myself is to properly understand, and 
    internalize this school of thought because I have walked down the path far enough to know
    that it is the way to enlightnment of the mind and that great beauty lies at the end of
    a challenging road.
  - Dadaji was another great entity from recent history who I respect for his attempt to bring
  this school of thought to the masses. He took the complex philosophy of the Advaita and
  distilled it to its essence so that even a young child could easily grasp the basic thoughts.
    - While his life's work resulted in a great deal of impact for a large number of people,
    since he passed away, Swadhyay has not been the same.
  - These are entities who have carved out a path to uplift man and provided them an elevator to
  heaven instead of a staircase. Nevertheless, they were, after all people. Eventually, one, if 
  lucky, reaches a point in their life where all of these philosophies seem childlike. My goal is
  to one day reach that point with the aggregate teachings of the Advaita, to one day, be forced
  to do research to come up with my own answers to my questions.
* Sheldon Cooper from 'The Big Bang Theory'
  - While I share some characteristics with all four of the main characters in the show,
  Sheldon is definitely the one that I associate myself with the most. In fact, I'm somewhat
  envious of his ability to focus on his work despite the personal drama that goes on around
  him, as well as his didatic memory. Furthermore, things like the roommate agreement, and the
  relationship agreement, seem like perfectly reasonable things to me. They would be things
  that I could see myself drafting up in real life (if I ever had the time).
  - Nevertheless, there are a few characteristics that we definitely do not share, such as
  his adversion to human contact. I am very much a "touch" person, by which I mean that I
  only feel close to someone through the sense of touch, as opposed to talking with them.
  I also strongly believe that sex is a vital part of a relationship and something that
  draws people together. The idea of not having sex for X years, or not having sex before marriage,
  is simply not an option for me.
    - Thinking about it practically, one would want the person they marry to be the one they
    have the best phyiscal experience with as well. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with
    me on this, but I feel strongly about that.
* Cumberbatch's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in 'Sherlock'
  - I share a lot of the same characteristics as Sherlock during times of stress or intense focus.
  When I'm thinking about a particularly challenging problem, I need complete silence and no
  distractions. I also often build a "mind-temple" to help me associate words, people and concepts
  with one another during times of focus.
* A Tiger :tiger-face:
  - The physical strength and fearceness of tigers are two of their most appealing characteristics.
  For some reason, I have always been attracted to tigers, and I hope to even own a pair of
  tigers one day (a pair so they can breed and don't die in captivity).
* A little kid
  - I love kids, and I often am child-like when it comes to things like cars, toys, video games etc.
  I make an effort to preserve my childhood innocence and boyish wonder as years go on.
  - The quintecential example of when I'm a little kid in a candy store is when I'm learning new
  computer science algorithms, or thinking about physics and mathematics. __IT'S JUST SO FREAKING
  COOL!!__
  - On the other hand, I'm also a child when it comes to getting shots, visiting the doctor or
  when I'm sick, tired, sleepy or hungry. Sometimes that's not a good thing, but my ideal
  life-partner would be someone who finds that cute, and sees the charm in it. Hopefully though,
  I'll grow up just a little bit before I have kids so that she doesn't have to deal with one
  more kid (I doubt it though :P).
* Just some "regular" guy
  - Just like everyone else I get jealous/angry, want to be a bum, sometimes desire things
  which aren't good for me, enjoy sex etc.
